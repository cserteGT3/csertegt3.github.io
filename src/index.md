@def title = "Home"

This is my blog, where I collect mostly programming related things.
As I really enjoy open source projects, I try to be as useful as possible.
You can find my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/cserteGT3/).

I want to put here a CV and probably something impressive thing too, as this is page looks pretty empty.
